Ferret
=======

Ferret is an information retrieval library in the same vein as [Apache Lucene][1].
Originally it was a full port of Lucene but it now uses it's own file format
and indexing algorithm although it is still very similar in many ways to
Lucene. Everything you can do in Lucene you should be able to do in Ferret.

Contents
=========

c/

    Ferret is written in C for speed. The actual C code should be fairly easy
    to use in an application or create bindings to a language other than Ruby.

ruby/

    This directory contains the Ruby bindings and tests. See ruby/README.md for
    information on installing Ferret's Ruby bindings

Instructions
============

* Build the gem: `cd ruby && rake gem`
* Publish the gem on github: see [RubyGems registry docs](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-rubygems-registry)
* Use in Gemfile: `gem "ferret", "0.11.9.0", source: "https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/acavalin"`
